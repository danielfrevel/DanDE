## About Me

I'm Dan, a full-stack developer working mostly with C#, Angular, and Python. I run NixOS and use Nix flakes for everything I can get away with. This blog is where I write down things I learn so I don't have to learn them twice.

## About This Blog

- **Hugo** - Static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Pagefind** - Static search
- **Docker + Nginx** - Deployment
